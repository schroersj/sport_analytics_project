# Sports Performance Analytics Dashboard

## Overview:
Develop a dashboard that analyzes and visualizes the performance of sports teams or athletes based on historical data. This project involves collecting sports statistics, performing data analysis, and creating a dynamic dashboard to showcase insights.

## Key Components:
### Data Collection:
Collect historical sports data from sources like sports APIs, CSV files, or web scraping. Focus on statistics related to player performance, team records, and match outcomes.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistency.

### Dashboard Development:
Create a dynamic web-based dashboard using a framework like Dash or Streamlit to visualize the analyzed data.
Include features like interactive charts, heatmaps, and filters for users to explore different aspects of sports performance.

### Prediction Model (Optional):
If interested, implement a simple prediction model using machine learning to forecast future match outcomes or player performances.

### User Authentication (Optional):
Add user authentication to allow users to save personalized views or preferences on the dashboard.
